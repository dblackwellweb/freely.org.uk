# Current Issues

The aim is to have a super simple website that provides no fuss no muss and clear access to an online viewable pdf flipbook and downladable pdfs to print.

## Visual

# transparent background for icons (they overlap sometimes due to bouncing)

# dont understand / clarify please. you want it to exand? it does but it shouldnt? what do you mean by expand into center?---->>> pop-up boxes (.selected)  to seem to expand into centre - jQuery slide-toggle?

## Functional

### Online pdf viewing
#### almost all browser have built in pdf viewers, so you might not need both options. e.g. in chrome, a link to a pdf opens the pdf in the browser, from where you can save it locally if you want. in that case both links would do more or less the same. If you relied on that you would even save us and the user the popup entirely. Basically we could make the original icon simply open the pdf in a new window directly
#### if you want one anyway, an online pdf viewer should be no problem. From a UI perspective I think you would want it full screen no? maybe with the other icons small on top like a small navigation to switch between pdfs?
#### depends on the pdfs, but probably the best solution would be to remake the pdfs in html... pdf is made for print, if the exact layout is not important it would make a lot of sense to redo their content in html. Much better for people who just want to have a look, especially on mobile. but again, depends on the content
